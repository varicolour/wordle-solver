# wordle-solver
A python script to solve a wordle game based on user feedback
(wordlist included)

# how to use
1. download the wordle-solver.py and wordlist.txt files
2. open wordle-solver.py in a text editor like notepad, visual studio code or kate
3. right click on your wordlist.txt file and copy the address
4. replace "path/to/your/wordlist" in wordle-solver.py with the address you copied
5. run the program in an IDE or the command line ($ python path/to/wordle-solver.py)
6. enter the green word it gives you into wordle or your wordle clone of choice
7. in the feedback section, put the first letter of the colour that the letter becomes (black, yellow or green). for example, if you enter the word "acorn" and the a is green, the c is yellow and the rest is black, you would enter "gybbb"
8. repeat step 6 & 7 until you have finished the wordle! (or the program breaks)
